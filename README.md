This game is coded based on the Godfather franchise (1972, 1974, 1990).
    Professor Chase Kusterer' Starter Code and Scripts served as a base and 
    inspiration for this game. 
    
    Watching the Godfather will definetly be an advantage for this game and
    will get you through a couple more phases! There is no way to "win" the 
    game, only to make it to the final shootout and get out alive.
    
    Respect if you can identify all of the sneaky references to the films ;)
    
    Next up you'll face:
    
    A Job interview;
    Meeting Corleone;
    First Assignment;
    Final Shootout.
